- This is a simple Automation with Selenium Webdriver, where I interact with the elements on a page 
sending different inputs or clicking on different buttons.
- I used 'sleep' after each line in the video for slowing down the process and to see the interractions with the elements

We have to install:
pip install selenium
pip install webdriver-manager
